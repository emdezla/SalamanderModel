# Salamander-Robotica Simulation
##### Florian Genilloud, Emilio Fern√°ndez, Joachim Durant

This is the final project for Computational Motor Control (2020 EPFL course). We made use of the Central Pattern Generator model explained in class for simulating a salamander capable of both swimming and walking. What's even more important, we were sucessful in developing a smooth transition from walking to swimming thanks to a fine parameter tuning. We explain the totality of our results in this [report](report.pdf).

The project is divided in several subexercises where we increase the model complexity step by step: 
+ First, we set all the parameters in `robot_parameters.py` and define the differential equations in `network.py` so that we can run  `exercise_example.py`without a problem and the behaviour is similar to the expected one in theory.
+ Next, in `exercise_8b.py`, we run a first grid search in order to obtain the most efficient (high speed and low energy) values for the amplitude gradient and the phase lag when swimming.
+ In `exercise_8c.py`, we study more in detail how does the amplitude gradient influence the speed and energy of the salamander.
+ In `exercise_8d.py`, we experiment again with the paramaters to induce turning and backwards swimming
+ In `exercise_8f.py`, we find the most optimal parameter values for a correct coordination between spine and limb joints
+ Finally, in `exercise_8d.py`, we adapt the salamander drive depending on its position in order to obtain a smooth land to water transition.
